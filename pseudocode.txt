# Define a CCTV part of image whose region has been detected
# Go to the path
# Prepare the map to be imshow-ed
# Get the coordinates and matrix coordinates
# # Specifically, parse from CSV of coordinates to matrix M
# For every CSV file in the frame image, sorted alphabetically:
# # Eliminate non-vehicles point (can be obtained from the "object" header)
  # For example, vehicles: truck, car, motorbike
# # For every bounding box vehicles:
# # # Find the bounding box center point
# # # Map the point according to transformation matrix M
# # # Done.
# # Now, for displaying purposes:
# # Draw the map and all the transformed points
# # In new window, draw the CCTV image with boxes
