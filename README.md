# Traffic Management System
# Data Science Analysis Project
## By DSweetA

This repo is based on PJreddie's YOLOv3 Darknet.
I did not add the PJReddie's commit because.
Well. I forget it.

But anyway, [here's the link to the original Darknet repo](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet).

To run this project, you will need to:
1. Download the CCTV and map data to root folder
1. Download the YOLOv3 pre-trained weights data to 'darknet' folder.

*More details coming soon...*
